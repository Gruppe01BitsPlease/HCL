4. Installation
   -------

   1. Extract archive to preferred installation path.
       1. NOTE!: only the jar file and libs folder are required to run this software.
   2. Run .jar file
   3. On first run you should get a pop-up asking you to provide your database settings.
      These settings need to be validated by clicking "save" before you can continue.
   4. Click on the red close window button. If you want to setup your database structure,
      click yes on the following popup. This is a requirement if the software never have been used
      on that database previously.
      1. NOTE!: Leave settings at default if you are unsure! This will not give any dataloss,
       and ensures that the required structure is present on the database.
   5. After settings are validated a config.properties should be created in the root folder.
      Steps 3-5 need to be repeated if settings get corrupted.
   6. Log with: user 'admin', password 'admin'.
   7. This password should be changed because this is the only account that got
      full access to every function of the software.
